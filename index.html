<li><p>A Github Insight App is designed to assist developers with daily routine tasks share useful insights from GitHub associated with developer productivity and enforce consistent development process implementation across all development.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It assists developers in identifying and addressing adverse practices occurring within GitHub repositories by leveraging data-driven actions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It offers an aesthetically pleasing terminal output to present repository-related data, facilitating the extraction of meaningful insights.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Getting-Started"><a href="#Getting-Started" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started:"></a>Getting Started:</h3><ul>
<li>Download the installer file<ul>
<li>Windows: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/gia-docs/gia_installer_files/blob/master/gia_installer_windows.ps1">gia_installer_windows.ps1</a></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Run the installer file via below steps:<ul>
<li>open the windows terminal(not command prompt, as it is unable to run the ps1 file), shell, mac Os shell respective to the operating system.</li>
<li>Navigate to the folder where you download the installer file by <code>cd \&lt;path&gt;</code> command. By default it will be download in user&#x2F;download folder.</li>
<li>Run the file by typing the file name.</li>
<li>Downloading will be started now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Verify the app is installed perfectly or not by running <code>gia</code> command.</li>
<li>If it prints description of app then you are good to go. Ensure to run <code>gia configure</code> command first.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="1-gia"><a href="#1-gia" class="headerlink" title="1. gia"></a>1. gia</h2><ul>
<li><p>It provides all of the commands present in the GitHub insight automation project and a small description about that particular command.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Option:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><code>-v, --version</code></p>
<p>Check the current version of the GitHub insight app CLI application.<br>Latest version of gia app is <code>1.0.0</code>.</p>
<h2 id="2-gia-configure"><a href="#2-gia-configure" class="headerlink" title="2. gia configure:"></a>2. gia configure:</h2><ul>
<li><p>It is designed for configuring the username, access token, and organization name required to execute commands specific to that particular configuration.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It will store the user-related configuration information which is asked by the configure command into the config file in the .gia folder, the config file is already configured at the install time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Usage: <code>gia configure</code></p>
</li>
<li><p>It will show the prompt that asks for the necessary configuration data from the user. Such as</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Username: This refers to the GitHub username, which is used to retrieve information associated with that username.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Access-Token: This is the access token provided to users, granting them access to their GitHub data.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Organization Name: This field is required to specify the organization to run the commands within a the organization on GitHub.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-gia-list-stale-branches"><a href="#3-gia-list-stale-branches" class="headerlink" title="3. gia list-stale-branches"></a>3. gia list-stale-branches</h2><ul>
<li><p>This command is used to fetch all of the stale-branches for the specific repository.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stale branches: Refer to those branches that have been successfully merged but have not been deleted after 20 days(default interval) from the merged time, you can specify the time-interval as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The command will read the organization value from the config file by default if the value is not provided by the <code>-o</code> option. The command is repo-spefic for -r &lt;repo-value&gt; and -o &lt;org-value&gt; -r &lt;repo-value&gt; options only.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Options:</p>
<p>  <code>-o &lt;value&gt;, --organization=&lt;value&gt;, –organization &lt;value&gt;</code></p>
<p>  In value, you have to specify the value of the organization in which you have to fetch the stale branches.</p>
<p>  <code>-r &lt;value&gt;, --repository=&lt;value&gt;, --repository &lt;value&gt;</code></p>
<p>  In value you have to specify the value of the repository name in which you want to fetch the stale branches.</p>
<p>  <code>--filter &lt;value&gt;</code></p>
<p>  To filter the repositories by &lt;value&gt;, It will filter and run the command on those repositories in which the &lt;value&gt; is present anywhere in repository name. This filter option is not useful when run the command on specific repository and effective on only run the command on organization. i.e. This option is only effective when user calls the command without <code>-o</code> and <code>-r</code> both and when user calls command with <code>-o</code> option only.    </p>
</li>
<li><p>The user is forced to enter the value of the chosen option. If the user wants to go for any of the option(s) and forgets or omits to enter the appropriate value then the command will give the error.  </p>
<p>  flag: <code>-e, --export</code></p>
<p>  It is the flag, if passed then it will store the output of the command in the csv format inside the .gia&#x2F;output folder.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the user calls the command <code>gia list-stale-branches</code> then It will fetch the organization value from the config file and the stale branches of all repositories of organization will be shown. If you want to run the command for other organization you are a part of then try <code>-o</code> option.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the user calls the command as <code>gia list-stale-branches -o &lt;orgval&gt; -r &lt;reponame&gt;</code> then the command will list the stale branches of the specified reponame of the specified orgval.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the user calls the command as <code>gia list-stale-branches -o &lt;orgval&gt;</code> then the command will execute for all the repositories of organization specified in orgval by the user in the command. This command is designed to run the default command but for other organization.   </p>
</li>
<li><p>If the user calls the command as <code>gia list-stale-branches -r &lt;reponame&gt;</code> then the command will execute for the repository specified in the reponame by the user in the command and the organization name will be read from the config file. The repository must be the part of the organization which is configured in the configure command otherwise it may lead to an error.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>  <strong>Note: –organization&#x3D;&lt;orgval&gt; and –organization &lt;orgval&gt; can be used instead of -o &lt;orgval&gt; and the same for -r as well.</strong></p>

If you want to run the command for other organization you are a part of then try <code>-o</code> option.   </p>
</li>
<li><p>If the user calls the command as <code>gia list-self-merged-prs -o &lt;orgval&gt; -r &lt;reponame&gt;</code> then the command will list all the self merged PRs of the reponame repository specified by user for the orgval specified by the user in the command.If the repository is not belong to the organization then it may lead to the error.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the user calls the command as <code>gia list-self-merged-prs -o &lt;orgval&gt;</code> then the command will list all the self merged PRs for all the repositories of the organization specified in &lt;orgval&gt; by the user in the command.

<li><p>The command is designed to delete the feature-release branches from the repository.
